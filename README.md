## 🧪 **Most Complex Integration Description**

> The Apollo SDR AI Bot was my most complex build. It combined Make.com routers, conditional branching, Claude prompt chaining, email validation (Bouncer API), fallback paths, webhook retries, and Claude fine-tuned personalization using contact metadata. It ran in parallel with 3-step fallback for failures and synced leads to Zoho using a dual-write system to avoid loss in case of Make errors.

## 🧰 **How I Debug a Failing Workflow**

- **Step 1**: Check Make’s execution history or Zapier's Task log.
- **Step 2**: Test each node/step individually using dummy data.
- **Step 3**: Use webhook.site or Postman to simulate external APIs.
- **Step 4**: Add `error handler branches` in Make or filter-based stops in Zapier.
- **Step 5**: If needed, I create a replica of the flow in sandbox mode, isolate the branch, and manually simulate failures with logs going to Slack or Google Sheets for traceability
